Building The420Coin Core

After you install the usual build tools and C++ development tools,
The420Coin Core also needs some build dependencies which are not always provided
by default by the OS package manager
(in particular BerkeleyDB 4.8 for building with wallet support).

Before trying to build, be sure to read one of these files,
depending on your environment:

  doc/build-unix.md
  doc/build-openbsd.md
  doc/build-osx.md
  doc/build-windows.md

After installing the needed dependencies,
use the autogen script to prepare the build environment.

	chmod 777 autogen.sh
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
	chmod 777 share/genbuild.sh
    make

Precompiled binaries are available at github, see
https://github.com/the420coincrypto/the420coincoin/releases

Always verify the signatures and checksums.

See doc/build-*.md for instructions on building the420coind,
the intended-for-services, no-graphical-interface,
reference implementation of The420Coin.
